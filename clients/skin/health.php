		<p>The term essential in medical science refers to thsoe items that the body requires for life, which cannot be produced by the body itself.  In other words, essential nutrients must be obtained from our diet.  Critically important among essential nutrients are the essential fatty acids.  Essential fatty acids were discovered in the 1920’s and first classified as Vitamin F.</p></div>


		<div class="section"><p><strong class="highlight_maroon">What is CLA?</strong></p>

		<p>Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) is an essential fatty acid that the body requires for numerous and fundamnetal physiological functions.  CLA was discovered in the late 1970’s, at the University of Wisconsin’s Food Research Institute by Michael Pariza while researching anti-cancer effects in various foods.  The active material was identified as CLA, and subsequent work by Pariza and his associates and others began to reveal its astonishing range of biological effects.  Since that time numerous studies have pointed out the anti-cancer and metabolic enhancing attributes of CLA.  Dozens of clinical and in vitro experiments have demonstrated CLA’s ability to protect healthy tissue from cancerous growth.  These include breast, colon and in particular skin cancer.</p>

		<p>Beginning in the 1990’s, CLA became and continues to be one of the most popular nutritional supplements in the Natural food industry.</p></div>


		<div class="section"><p><strong class="highlight_maroon">CLA and the Skin</strong></p>

		<p>Multiple studies have been performed that underscore the positive health effects that oral consumption of CLA has on the skin and muscle.  These include reduction in fat, increased insulin sensitivity which is critical for improved diabetes control and preevntion of tumor growth.  One of the most important limitations with taking CLA orally is that it is difficult to achieve the very highest levels of CLA at the tissue level.  By the time the CLA is absorbed through digestion, circulates throughout the entire body and finally arrives at teh skin cells, the concentration is signficantly weakened.  <a href="#">Read More &gt;</a></p></div>


		<div class="section"><p><strong class="highlight_maroon">CLA Skin Products</strong></p>

		<p>Clearly, by applying CLA directly to the skin, one can achieve as high a level of CLA as desired.  The advantages are many:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>no need for clearance through digestion</li>
			<li>no adverse symetric effects</li>
			<li>ideal levels that protect and nurture the skin are attained without ingesting massive doses</li>
		</ul>

		<p>SkinApparel has formulated the world’s first CLA Skin Care Products:</p>
